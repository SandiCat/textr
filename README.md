# Codename "textr"

"Tinder, but with text instead of pictures." WIP webapp for making friends with people all over the world.


**Backend:** Haskell with servant and beam. Tests using hedgehog and tmp-postgres.

**Frontend:** Elm with elm-ui. API calls autogenerated from servant. Parcel for building.

**Build system:** Haskell, using shake. Not in use.

**Dev environemnt:** A fish script that starts [devd](https://github.com/cortesi/devd) (as the dev server), ghcid (haskell with live reload), parcel dev server and tmp-postgres for the database.

**Deployment:** Docker, nginix and google cloud; considering a completely different approach.
